    <h1>What is calamari?</h1>
    <p>Is calamari squid or octopus? Calamari is the Italian word for squid, a cousin to 
        octopus. Squid is firm and white with a mild, slightly sweeter taste that lends 
        itself to so many flavors. There are more than 300 species of squid in the world's 
        waters, but fewer than a dozen are utilized in cooking.
    </p>
    <p>Squid is available in most grocery stores and, thankfully, it is not very 
        expensive. You can find it at the fish counter but, more often, in the freezer 
        aisle. In this calamari recipe, I used wild-caught frozen calamari tubes, which 
        are already cleaned. Frozen calamari rings are also available and will work in 
        this recipe.

    <h2>5 Tips for the best crispy fried calamari recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Do not cut the calamari rings too thinly</strong>. I cut my squid tubes 
            into ¾-inch thick rings, which extends the cooking time long enough for the 
            flour coating to brown and crisp up nicely, while making sure that the calamari 
            is tender on the inside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Soak the rings in a solution of salted milk for 30 minutes 
                (refrigerated) before cooking.</strong>I shared this earlier, but this is 
                the trick to tenderizing the calamari meat and it also helps tame the fishy taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>For crispy fried calamari, coat the rings in a mixture of flour, 
                cornstarch, and baking powder!</strong> You'll get a golden-brown, 
                crispy exterior on the tender squid rings.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Once coated in the flour mixture, allow the squid rings a few short 
                minutes to sit in a colander before frying.</strong> This allows the flour 
                to rehydrate so that the coating does not fall off the calamari when fried. 
                This will happen naturally anyway as you wait for the oil to heat, and 
                you will be frying the calamari in batches which will allow enough time 
                for the coating to stick.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Manage the heat of your cooking oil. Heat the oil to somewhere between
            350 and 365 degrees F before cooking the calamari.</strong> The more common 
            problem with oil temperature is that it is often too low and the calamari 
            will absorb too much of the oil and become too soggy or chewy. And if the oil 
            is too hot, the outside will burn before the inside is cooked properly. 
            So that is why it is important to manage the oil heat. An oil thermometer is 
            helpful here, but <strong>if you do not have a thermometer, how do you know if
            the oil is ready for frying?</strong> To test, drop just one calamari ring in 
            the oil, lots of gentle bubbles should form around it immediately and the 
            calamari and bubbles begin to float to the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve ASAP!</strong> Fried calamari rings are at their best when 
            served as nice and warm with a big splash of lemon juice!
        </li>

    <h2>How do you make fried calamari from scratch?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Slice into rings</strong></h3>
            <p>Unless you already bought calamari rings, you'll start by cutting the cleaned 
            tubes into ¾-inch thick rings.</p>

        </li>
            <h3><strong>Soak in salted milk</strong></h3>
            <p>In a medium bowl, stir 1 teaspoon of kosher salt in ½ cup of milk. Add the 
                squid rings and toss. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Dredge</strong></h3>
            <p>Prepare a flour mixture by whisking together 1 ½ cup all-purpose flour, ⅓ 
                cup cornstarch, ½ teaspoon baking powder, ¾ teaspoon of dry oregano, 
                and ½ teaspoon each black pepper and cayenne. Toss a few calamari rings 
                in the flour mixture until well-coated, then transfer them to a colander. 
                Repeat until all the calamari is coated in the flour mixture.</p>

            height="500" width="600"><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><strong>Fry and Drain</strong></h3>
            <p>Fill a small 2.5-quart pot or saucepan with 4 inches of grapeseed oil and 
                heat the oil to somewhere between 350 and 365 degrees F. Drop one calamari
                 ring, if the oil bubbles and forms around it and the calamari brings to 
                 float, the oil is ready. You can now cook the squid rings in batches 
                 (about 8 at a time) for 3 minutes or until golden brown.</p>
            <p>Prepare a tray and put a wire rack covered with paper towel on top. 
                As the calamari cook, use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked crispy 
                rings to the prepared wire rack. If you have your oven heated on the 
                lowest setting, you can stick the cooked calamari in it to keep them 
                nice and warm. To test your oil, drop one calamari ring, many bubbles 
                will form around it and the calamari will begin to float.</p>
